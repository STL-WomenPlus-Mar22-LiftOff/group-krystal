<!-- <p>app home page</p> -->

<!-- nothing shows up here when you ng serve this app 
    because it is using a template found in app.component.ts

In app.component.ts:
    it will replace the tag  <router-outlet></router-outlet> with the 
component called by the path/URL. you can see which component is linked 
to which path in app-routing.module.ts-->
